                        <h2>Our Story</h2>
                        <p>The Movement (Tafiyar Matasa), also known simply as The Movement, was founded in August 2024 by a coalition of northern Nigerian activists and social media influencers, including <b>Dr. Bulama Bukarti</b> as its Chief Convener. It emerged as a powerful response to the frustrations of Nigerian youth, particularly after the #EndBadGovernance protest on August 1, 2024.</p>
                        <p>From its inception, The Movement has been dedicated to mobilizing young Nigerians to demand better governance and create positive change within their communities. Though it is still in the early stages of establishing its presence across all local government areas, The Movement has already begun setting up structures in several states, with plans to expand nationwide.</p>

    { title: "Why All Patriotic Nigerians Must Support The Youth Movement", date: "October 06, 2024", excerpt: "By Ismail Hashim Abubakar, PhD <br>I have had sleepless nights these days reflecting and worrying over the ordeal my fellow Nigerians are passing through that ranges from inflation, hunger, and fuel price hikes to insecurity, not to talk of the usual and condonable suffering of lack of social amenities as essential as electricity, water supply, education and healthcare provision, employment, roads and so on. <br>Poor Nigerians are now literally dying of starvation, and the government seems to be myopically unprepared to decisively fight famishment by countering the inflation of food items, much less than investigating and gathering the statistics of those who lost their lives due to lack of food. The hardship results from years of bad leadership and corruption that bedevil Nigeria. My worries worsen when I look at the right, left, and centre of Nigerian politics. I cannot envisage any tangible attempts to reduce or checkmate these unbearable life burdens and simplify things for my fellow compatriots.  It is so disheartening to see that matters which did not constitute part of our problems a few years ago are now huge issues that citizens have to grapple with for them to make ends meet, with millions of Nigerians now wishing to miraculously return to where they were less than a decade ago. Nigerians are desperately looking for ways to articulate and reassert their essential human need for survival to hearing the deaf ears of their leaders, who are always mischievously claiming to be good listeners but who are viewed by their subjects as oppressors and draconian rulers. This explains why all the efforts of the government, which manifested in clerical interventions, propaganda and security threats, all to thwart the mass hunger protest organised and held by Nigerians in August, ended in fiasco, albeit, of course, it was later extinguished undemocratically with excessive use of force to disenfranchise Nigerians. The government would have mildly aborted the August hunger protest if it sincerely attacked hunger by arresting the increasing rise of prices of commodities and by restoring the fuel subsidy, which President Bola Ahmed Tinubu announced on the day he was sworn in even before stepping into his office. Nigerians are still shocked by how the government found solace in procuring a multimillion-dollar jet and yacht for the President as his subjects still languish in economic misery. Nigerians are puzzled by the unresponsiveness of their leaders to public concerns. Organisations like the NLC and ASUU have lost their influence, and religious scholars and public speeches no longer hold the same sway over public opinion and elections. Nowadays, prominent clerics defend politicians, posing as their spokespersons. This shift marks a radical change in the relationship between the political class and religious elites. It's important to remember that Nigerian politicians often have a give-and-take mentality when dealing with religious leaders. Some scholars compromise their truth by accepting gifts from politicians. While some scholars have joined the government and performed well, many have completely changed after doing so. All these have combined to intensify the pessimism of the Nigerian masses, who are tired and so desperate, looking for solutions to their country, which is on the brink of precipice. The emergence of a movement mobilised by Nigerian youth, meant for all patriotic citizens in an actual sense, is a significant sign that things have reached the peak of their flashpoints. From the speeches of the founders of the youth movement, one can infer that it is a mass struggle born out of tiredness with the current leadership system and which aims at displacing the despotism of the ruling and political class by way of justifiably hijacking the loyalty of citizens to partisan politics and redirecting them towards supporting selfless, sincere, committed, development-oriented, transparent, accountable and law-abiding governance which the nascent movement aspires to help produce.  The movement seeks to prosecute a mild political revolution that will end regimes of impunity, lawlessness, corruption, bribery, lack of integrity, massive looting, thievery, embezzlement, sabotage, cruelty and all forms of vices that characterise the attitudes of the minority of people who run the affairs of Nigeria. The ambitious movement hopes to halt the situation in which a few people, just by being at the helm of affairs, monopolise the country's wealth to service their selfish ends, greedily devouring public resources, treating the national assets as their estate, too hell-bent to exploit and feast on the local treasures while simultaneously refusing to improve public infrastructure and avoiding local healthcare, leaving the education system in dilapidated conditions. They race for medical care in foreign hospitals and send their children to study abroad.  It is alleged that Nigerian leaders have already mortgaged millions of barrels of crude oil that the country is expected to produce within the next 30 years to foreign business institutions. Even if this allegation has not yet been proven, the kind of treatment the newly established Dangote Refinery receives from the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPCL) speaks volumes to the weight of such an allegation. The youth movement is a herculean task that some may dismiss as practically impossible and utopian. For someone familiar with Nigeria and how it operates, the tip of the iceberg of which is only known by ordinary citizens, one may not accuse pessimistic sentiments towards reform of nurturing despair in this direction. At the same time, however, for someone who hears about or reads how some countries passed through similar tribulations and after some extraordinary efforts of some patriotic men they scaled through and overcame challenges, one cannot help but accept that the salvation struggle can as well succeed. There has to be a serious, sustainable and resilient plan, genuine will and invincible determination for all those who believe in the struggle to make strong dedications and major sacrifices.", image: "images/TMLogo2.jpg" },
    { title: "Why I Joined The Movement(Tafiyar Matasa): A Call to Action for Nigeria's Future", date: "September 18, 2024", excerpt: "As a young Fulani man, I've witnessed firsthand the devastating impact of Nigeria's failing political system. For 20 years, from 1999 to date, our leaders have failed to address the country's most pressing issues. Poverty, unemployment, insecurity, lack of quality healthcare, education, and environmental degradation have become the norm. Corruption and disunity have entrenched themselves in our society. <p>The Failure of Current Political Leaders</p> The statistics are staggering: Over 80 million Nigerians live below the poverty line. Unemployment rates hover around 23%. - Insecurity has claimed thousands of lives and displaced millions. Healthcare and education systems are in shambles. Environmental degradation threatens our very existence. The Fulani community, in particular, has suffered greatly. Expert estimates suggest that over $12 billion of Fulani herders' inheritance and livelihoods have been lost in the last 20 years. Families that have managed their animals for over 200 years have seen their livelihoods destroyed, with little to no support from the government. It's only recently that the government has taken practical steps to address this issue by creating the Ministry of Livestock. The Need for Youth Led Change It's clear that our current leaders are incapable of addressing these problems. We need fresh perspectives, innovative solutions, and a new generation of leaders who understand the urgency of our situation. The youth movement offers hope for a better future. A Vision for a Better Nigeria  We envision a Nigeria where: Every citizen has access to quality healthcare and education. Poverty and unemployment are significantly reduced. Insecurity is a thing of the past. Corruption is eradicated. Our environment is protected. We believe in uniting Nigerians across ethnic and religious lines, fostering a sense of belonging and shared purpose. Lessons from Senegal. Senegal's successful youth-led movements and reforms offer valuable lessons. Empowering young leaders to drive change can transform a nation. A Call to Action", image: "images/news2.jpg" },

But remember the truth is always truth and can stand alone. <br>No doubt that not everyone is happy with how leadership is running in this country, with the exception of those at the corridor of power. But this is not enough to be a raison d'être to handle our dear nation to the hands of inexperienced youths. Forgive my pen for the use of 'inexperienced'. Just because most of them have never been to real leadership. Of course, I am myself opposed to the exclusionary habit of the present politicians, they've relegated youths to the mantle of power but we have to cautiously control our faculty of thinking to avoid getting entangled in a lust for power. <br>I was very happy when I heard the idea of 'The Movement' known as 'Tafiyar Matasa' in the Hausa language. And of course, the genesis of the movement was attributed to the unavoidable 'EndBadGovernance' protest of 1st August, 2024. The movement began immediately after the protest, in fact, it is one of the noticeable outcomes of the protest due to the unity it brought. The idea of the movement was preached and promoted by some prominent northern activists and social media influencers to serve as a last resort to the youths in their effort to bring good governance. No one can deny the fact this is a laudable effort. But the very big question supposed to be asked here is: youthfulness is the only parameter and yardstick to measure the caliber of a good leader? If yes, why Yahaya Bello (Former Governor of Kogi) and Abdurrasheeed Bawa (former EFCC Boss) were arraigned for looting the public treasury! The point I want to make here is, being young or old will not be a determining factor for an individual to be a good leader. We can have corrupt leaders within any range of age. <br>Another important issue to take into cognizance is the failure of some youths to comprehend the logic and existing distinction between being a good activist and being a good leader. Leadership is quite different from activism, therefore, a good activist may not necessarily be a good leader. It is common knowledge that the conveners of this important movement lack practical leadership acumen and organizational skills that are fundamental for successful leadership. Okay, should we handle our future to the trial and error leaders? We have to exercise extraordinary care when it comes to leadership. <br>Yet another problem faced by this movement is financial constraints. To be sincere and frank, the quantum resources required to run a great national political movement like this oversizes the pockets of the conveners. Another organic question to ask here is: where the movement conveners can solicit humongous financial resources? From the politicians they are castigating? If yes, this is performative contradiction! <br>Finally, I would like to remind my fellow youths that new breed, as the late Yusuf Maitama said, cannot solve the Nigerian problem. There must be mutual cooperation and understanding between the new breed and old breed. We must work together with them to acquire all necessary experience, knowledge, and practical leadership skills. <p>Written by</p> Comr.

    { title: "Youths Launches The Movement (Tafiyar Matasa) At The Presentation of the New Nigerian Movement", date: "September 18, 2024", excerpt: "Dr. Bulama Bukarti Announces the Launch of The Movement (Tafiyar Matasa) at Maiden Public Presentation of the New Nigerian Movement <br>Abuja, Nigeria — Today, Dr. Bulama Bukarti, Chief Convener of The Movement (Tafiyar Matasa), delivered a groundbreaking address during the maiden public presentation of the New Nigerian Movement, signaling a new chapter in Nigeria's political landscape. <br>Speaking to a gathering of Nigerian youths and concerned citizens, Dr. Bukarti highlighted the urgent need for change, lamenting the state of the nation. 'Our beloved country, once known for its boundless potential, now finds itself shackled by a political system that no longer serves its people,' he remarked, setting the tone for a powerful call to action. <br>The Movement (Tafiyar Matasa) was unveiled as a rallying force aimed at combating corruption, restoring security, controlling inflation, and uplifting the standard of living for all Nigerians. Dr. Bukarti emphasized the core mission of the movement: 'This is not just a movement; it is a clarion call to every Nigerian youth and well-meaning citizen who believes in the future of our country.' <br>In his speech, Dr. Bukarti laid out five key reasons why patriotic Nigerians should join the movement, stressing the failure of the political class and the need for a new generation of leadership. 'The political class, both those in power and those in opposition, have failed us... The same faces, the same names, the same recycled promises will not move this country forward,' he declared, urging Nigerians to take control of their future. <br>Dr. Bukarti also highlighted the importance of integrity and transparency in leadership, a cornerstone of The Movement's philosophy: 'Our leaders will be chosen based on their integrity, their track record of service, and their willingness to be accountable.' <br>The Movement promises a grassroots approach to governance, emphasizing inclusivity and unity across the nation's diverse regions. 'Our movement is for the people, by the people. This is a movement for the masses, funded by the people, and driven by the need for a Nigeria where every citizen has access to prosperity,' he said: Calling for national unity, Dr. Bukarti expressed that The Movement is not confined to any one region or demographic, but is a clarion call for all Nigerians. 'While it began in northern Nigeria, its fundamental goal is to foster national unity, cohesion, and prosperity,' he explained. <br>In closing, Dr. Bukarti urged all Nigerians to join hands in shaping a better future. 'The future belongs to those who dare to fight for it. And today, we begin that fight.' <br>The YES Movement a Pioneering leadership forum congratulates the new movement and advice them to keep the ethics of uniting the country and her people. 'It is important for major stakeholders in the country come together to help mentor, guide and support the processes of growing and helping emerging leaders', added Hon Mary.", image: "images/TMLogo2.png" }
